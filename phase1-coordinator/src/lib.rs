//! This library contains the backend logic for running a zero
//! knowledge proof system setup ceremony, designed to generate a
//! genesis block out of the contributions from many people. The
//! theory is that the more contributors that participate from the
//! general public, the less likely it is that every contributor is
//! dishonest. It only takes one honest contributor to create a secure
//! genesis block. This ceremony is different to previously run setup
//! ceremonies in that it allows multiple contributors to contribute
//! in parallel.
//!
//! The central piece of code of this library is the [Coordinator],
//! which orchestrates the ceremony. The coordinator is created with a
//! set of parameters specified in [environment::Environment], these
//! parameters will differ between development, testing and production
//! use cases.
//!
//! A ceremony consists of 3 different types of
//! [objects::Participant]s. Regular contributors, replacement
//! contributors (which wait in standby during a round to replace a
//! contributor which is dropped), and verifiers which verify the
//! submitted contributions as they arrive.
//!
//! See [objects::task::initialize_tasks] for an in depth explanation
//! of how the [objects::task::Task]s for each participant in the
//! ceremony are generated depending on the number of chunks and the
//! number of participants in the round.
